# Flutter Weather App

<div align="center">

## The App

I developed this app to deepen my understanding of integrating various APIs. I obtained my API key from OpenWeather and employed error handling using blocks to manage both successful and unsuccessful outcomes. Assets sourced from Romain Girou's YouTube channel were utilized in the current design.

Moving forward, I aim to update the icons and enhance the app's visual presentation with a minimalist touch of my own. Exploring iPhone permissions, including requesting user location, was an enlightening experience. I also gained insights into managing diverse weather conditions by interfacing with the website's API.
